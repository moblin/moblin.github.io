title: About me

Hi, welcome to Tech Blog Inspire, a site dedicated to self-improvement, technology, and most of all, documenting my personal journey. 

I’m currently working in the Health sector as an information technologist providing desktop and network related services. Networking is definitely my bread and butter, the thing I know most about and above all enjoy the most. Nothing excites me more than jumping right into the CLI and getting my hands dirty, learning about the network, and providing unique solutions. I enjoy working with open source technologies as well, as these can provide unique opportunities for the business, especially if funding is limited.  Under certain circumstances, it can also assist in disaster recovery scenarios.  

My insatiable thirst for knowledge keeps me constantly seeking out ways to self-improve whether it be through literature, videos or trudging through the trenches of the internet. Lately I've been interested in Devops and Docker related technologies in the context of networks and network automation. 

### Tech that I’m familiar with: 
- Cisco IOS – Routing and Switching 
- HP Aruba – Routing and Switching 
- OpenBSD 
- FreeBSD 
- Linux 
- Basic Docker skills  - Docker-compose 

### Future goals: 
- Learn python 
- Become fluent in Ansible (Network automation) 
- Learn bash shell scripting 
- Learn Powershell
